          <h4>Overview:</h4>
            <p>Apps and Mortar is a startup Co-Founded by Andrew Amann and Elizabeth Long that creates rapid prototypes for its clients. While with Apps and Mortar I worked on a project for a client in the juvenile products industry. The goal for the project was to create a prototype of a phone application that could pair with a purchased baby monitor. This project eventually spun off into two separate applications as our research highlighted the need to reduce the amount of features in the initial application.</p>
            <p>We worked in three week sprints to deliver research/ design findings and an iterated prototype to the client.</p> 
          <h4>Project Goal:</h4>
            <p>Focus on the initial interaction for a mom who purchased a monitor and was connecting it to the app she downloaded. The goal was to ensure the user experience was easy, clear, and reinforced the security of using an app to view the monitor. To create and present a working idea that let us understand if mom’s would find value in combining tracking data, photos, and events related to their children in one place. In addition, we explored mom’s behavior and current usage patterns around sharing and coordinating information.</p>
            <p>There were 3 phases to this project:<br>
            1. Initial Research, Prototyping, and User Testing<br>
            2. Final Prototyping and User Testing<br>
            3. Prototyping and User Testing of Secondary App</p>
         <h4>Team, Role, Tasks:</h4>
            <p>Three person team that consisted of both Co-Founders one acting solely as a designer, the other as a researcher/ designer, and myself. I worked as a researcher and worked closely with both team members to communicate research findings and turn them into actionable design changes. Tasks included surveys, script and question creation, sourcing and scheduling users for testing, moderated and unmoderated usability testing (including note taking), user flow documentation, and communication of research findings.</p>
          <h4>1. Initial Research, Prototyping, and User Testing</h4>
            <p>Inital research was conducted by my fellow team members before I came on board and included stakeholder interviews, competitive analysis, and surveys. From survey findings they found that moms tended to be the main caretakers and most likely to use the app to monitor their baby. They chose to focus on parents with a child one year or younger because this is the age in which parents tended to be most focused on monitoring their child.
            <p>Questions we were looking to answer:<br>
            <strong>Account Setup:</strong> What do you think of this setup process? What questions do you have?<br><strong>Camera Setup:</strong> Can we make the steps of this process easy and clear?<br><strong>Controlling Camera:</strong> Can the user get access to the live feed of the camera? Is there a way to create a simple interaction for reviewing manually and automatically collected "moments" captured by the monitor?</p>
            <p>My work began with sourcing users to begin scheduling testing and creating a script for the testing process. Before performing my own moderated test I sat in on a moderated test conducted by my fellow researcher. Myself and the other researcher then began to individually conduct moderated usability tests. During these tests we had to ask questions and also take notes. We then would review each others notes and videos to refine our questions and communicate our findings to the designer on the team in order to rapidly iterate the prototype.</p>
            <p>I also worked to create unmoderated tests on UserTesting.com and Validately. I had to make sure the tasks I created were clear and would give valuable feedback. I then reviewed the videos and took notes of the feedback to communicate with the other team members.</p>
            <p>Through our testing we found:
              <ul>
                <li>users expected to be taken directly to a login or account setup screen when opening the app</li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          <h4>2. Final Prototyping and User Testing</h4>
            <p></p>
          <h4>3. Prototyping and User Testing of Secondary App</h4>
            <p></p>  
          <h4>Project Outcome:</h4>
