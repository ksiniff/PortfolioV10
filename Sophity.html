        <h4>Overview:</h4>
          <p>This project was completed as my partner project while at the Startup Institute and spanned for 6 weeks during the 8 week program. My team worked closely with the Sophity team during this time to reach our deliverables.</p>
          <p>Sophity is an early-stage software business in the Boston area that provides SaaS-based solutions for consulting and other project-oriented teams, like product management and engineering. Sophity automates the collection of mission-critical data and use machine learning and predictive analytics to identify opportunities to reduce business costs and increase revenue for their customers. They are experts in professional services and work with their customers to improve business processes that drive revenue, margin, and customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p>The project had 2 phases:<br>
          1. Information Gathering and Research<br>
          2. Design and Development</p> 
        <h4>Project Goal:</h4>
          <p>Sophity had a free “Health Check” lead generation offering that was poorly marketed, hosted through an off site service, and required manual calculation of the results to deliver to the customer. They were looking to build a systematic approach to delivering the Health Check at higher, more scalable volumes and marketing the free offering as a lead generation tool. Sophity also wanted to be able to store the data collected from the Health Check in their database to incorporate into their machine learning software.</p>
          <p>After speaking with the Sophity team we settled on a deliverable that consisted of:
            <ul>
              <li>Creating an application with current survey questions for the “Health Check” that would be hosted on the Sophity website</li>
              <li>Application would give automated results to user and Sophity</li>
              <li>Designing and creating the WordPress page for the “Health Check” </li>
              <li>Creating a back end solution that would allow the information gathered from the application to be used in Sophity’s current environment</li>
            </ul>
          </p>   
        <h4>Team, Role, and Tasks:</h4>
          <p>My team consisted of two designer, a front-end developer, and a back-end developer. My role on the team was as both a researcher and designer. My tasks included user research, wireframing, and implementation of final design on the WordPress site.</p>
        <h4>1. Information Gathering and Research</h4>
          <p>The project began with my team receiving a document with information about Sophity and the scope of the project. We began by researching the company and creating a list of questions to further clarify the goals for the project and the users of the “Health Check” application for our first meeting with Sophity’s Co-Founder and CEO Andrea Mulligan.</p>
          <p>During our information gathering session we found that the target audience for the application was leaders of professional services organizations (VP/ Director of Professional Services, Client Service, Customer Success, and Technical Services) and that Sophity was currently targeting smaller software businesses (under 1000 employees with less than 50 consultants).</p>
          <p>I was able to perform a user interview with one of the three users who had taken the off site “Health Check”.<br>
          Questions I was looking to answer:
          <ul>
            <li>Is the survey’s length a deterrent to finishing? (original survey was 50 questions)</li>
            <li>Does the survey convey that Sophity are experts in their field?</li>
            <li>If the user scored well on their results would they be willing to retake the survey in a few months to reassess?</li>
            <li>Did the user find value in the “Health Check” survey and the corresponding results?</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Through the user interview I discovered:
          <ul>
            <li>the user felt the survey questions “were very high level” and instilled trust that Sophity were “very knowledgeable in this field”</li>
            <li>the survey was not too long or difficult</li>
            <li>the user would be willing to retake the survey in a few months to reassess</li>
            <li>the user would be interested if the survey “gave me results in comparison to the competition to better assess where my company lies”</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
          <h4>2. Design and Development</h4>
            <p>Myself and the other designer began our design portion of the project by each sketching low-fidelity wireframes for the “Health Check” page. We then iterated these designs and combined them to create a clearly sketched and annotated wireframe to bring to the client. We then took the clients feedback and reiterated our designs into a low-fidelity wireframe using Sketch. We iterated on this design a few times till arriving at our final higher-fidelity wireframe that incorporated Sophity’s style guide. I then began implementing our designs into a new WordPress page.</p>
            <img src="#">
            <p>I had never used WordPress before so I had to troubleshoot and alter some of our designs due to the limitations within the WordPress environment. During this process I also used some of my HTML and Javascript knowledge.</p>
            <p>During this time the developers on the team worked on creating the application, getting the application to send the results to the user and Sophity, and developing a solution to store the data gathered. As a team we worked on testing the application and making sure the style of the application matched Sophity’s style guide.</p>
          <h4>Project Outcome:</h4>
            <p>Our WordPress page for the “Health Check” is complete but currently not live. Due to issues with our back-end developer we were unable to create a solution to send the results and store the data. Because of this issue we had to find a new back-end developer and our front-end developer is currently working with the new team member to finish the application.</p>
          <h4>Project Reflections:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>When working on a project with a short turnover, realistic deliverables must be communicated to the client and tracking progress on current state of the project needs to constantly occur within the team.</li>
              <li>Creating better defined roles at the beginning of the project would have lessened the frustrations felt by some team members.</li>
              <li>Immediately addressing communication issues and other problems with a team member is vital when working in a short time-frame.</li>
              <li>Next steps would be to conduct interviews on users of the new application and data analysis to determine if the “Health Check” was creating leads.</li>
