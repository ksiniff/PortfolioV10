          <h4>Overview:</h4>
            <p>DropZone for Veterans is a for-profit customizable online aggregator of veteran opportunities, resources, and benefits. DropZone strives to not just create a searchable database but also a community for veterans and their family members where they feel valued, authentically represented, and empowered.</p>
            <p>This project was part of a 24 hour hackathon at Startup Institute. My team’s focus on getting users to the desired end state while keeping our designs easy to implement won us 1st place.</p>
            <p>The project had two phases:<br>
                1. Information Gathering, User Research, Personas<br>
                2. Ideation and Wireframing</p>
          <h4>Project Goal:</h4>
            <p>The overall goal was to redesign DropZone for Veterans webpage and pitch our ideas at the end of the 24 hour time limit. Below is the goal we were given during the stakeholder interview.</p>
            <p>Getting the users to leave the DropZone site in the desired end state:
              <ul>
                <li>user is engaged allowing them to leave the site understanding what the company does, what it believes in, and where it is going.</li>
                <li>as an individual, feel inspired, empowered and unstoppable.</li>
                <li>feel part of something bigger than themselves.</li>
              </ul>
            </p> 
          <h4>Team, Role, and Tasks:</h4>
             <p>My team of four was assigned by Startup Institute staff and consisted of myself and another UX designer along with two back-end developers. Myself and two other team members worked on improving the information architecture of the beta site and I also performed the user research, created personas, and worked with the other designer to create the websites final design. My tasks included user research, persona development, information architecture, and wireframing.</p>
          <h4>1. Information Gathering, User Research, Pesonas</h4>
            <p>A stakeholder interview with DropZone Founder/ CEO and former Army Engineer Captain Courtney Wilson revealed that the existing way that veterans receive information on military discounts, benefits, and services is a major pain point. Currently military members and their families receive this information in lengthy emails with multiple attachments. The information contained in the emails is not tailored to the individual forcing the reader to wade through information not relevant to them. This has caused much of the over $100 million in grants and services specifically allotted to veterans and their families to go unused. Another major pain point for veterans is that existing systems pigeon hole them into categories rather than capturing their individuality.</p>
            <p>To verify the pain points and to better understand the motives of possible users I interviewed 3 veterans and 2 military spouses. I wanted to see how the users would navigate the current beta version of the site and learn more about how they use technology to connect within the  community. I asked the users some initial questions to determine their pain points and then had them view the beta site. Research confirmed the pain points, especially that of being pigeon holed, and showed users wanted ways to filter benefits based on their individual needs. Usability testing of the site revealed a need to better organize and filter the benefits information, add more to the about section to instill trust in the company, and a want for better community outreach options.</p>

            <p>Through the initial stakeholder interview and the user research we found there were two types of users who would be visiting the site:
              <ul>
                <li>veterans</li>
                <li>those in their support system (i.e. family & friends)</li>
              </ul></p>
            <p>We wanted the site to be welcoming to both user types and easy for each to navigate to the information they may be searching for.</p>
            <p>In order for the team to better understand the users and to keep the design centered around them I created some quick user personas. </p>

          <h4>2. Ideation and Wireframing</h4>
              <p>Based on the stakeholder interview, user interviews, and an inspection of the beta site my team knew we needed to: 
              <ul>
                <li>update the information architecture</li>
                <li>filter information based on the individual user</li>
                <li>add a feature that allowed users to connect to the community</li>
              </ul></p>
              <p>We began the ideation phase by diverging to brainstorm a new site IA, user flows for searches, and ways to connect users to the community at large. We then came together to discuss our ideas and our initial wireframes. We agreed on a changes to the homepage’s IA and based on the data from the research we knew that we needed to keep the designs simple.</p>
              <p>The team created some low-fidelity wireframes and then I worked in Sketch with the other designer to quickly create a high-fidelity mockup of the homepage while the other two team members created a slideshow for our pitch. The team also brainstormed initial ideas for the mobile version to present during the pitch.</p>

          <h4>Project Outcome:</h4>
            <p>Our project won 1st place in the hackathon due to our focus on keeping the designs simple and user focused, creating individualized dashboards for users with an events calendar, and ease of implementation. DropZone is currently implementing some of our ideas into their current website  https://dropzoneforveterans.com/.</p>
          <h4>Project Reflections:</h4>
            <p>When working in a short time frame for a client with limited resources it is important to design solutions that focus on user needs while keeping in mind difficulty of implementation.<br>
            Given more time to work on the project I would have:
              <ul>
                <li>Built out the dashboard feature</li>
                <li>Put more thought into the visual design of the site</li>
                <li>Researched our ideas for the mobile version of the site</li>
                <li>Created a prototype of both versions</li>
                <li>Performed usability tests to confirm user flow and design choices</li>
                <li>Re-iterate</li>
              </ul>
